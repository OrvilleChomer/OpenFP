# OpenFP
Data and scripts I've created for the Open FP Group in Forest Park, IL

Right now, I have a web scraping script to glean public property tax data for Forest Park from: http://cookcountypropertyinfo.com/default.aspx and save it to a json file.

It is written in Node.js using Google's Puppeteer.

###Features that I want to add to this script:

- Collect yearly tax billed amounts & tax history
- Collect yearly exemption information (seems to be just if there is an exemption or not)
- Collect yearly appeals information (seems to be just if there were appeals or not)
- Collect documents, deeds & liens information
